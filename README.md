# Jupyter Notebook Tools
This is a set of tools that is designed to facilitate science in the context of Osmo Systems.
The code herein generally expects to be run in the context of a jupyter notebook.

## What lives here

Here's the basic heuristic for what should live in this library vs. in a notebook. **yes to all** = probably it should live here. **no to any** = probably not.

* Is this function reusable across many experiments/activities?
* Will that still be true for the foreseeable future?
* Is it fairly Osmo-specific?


Examples of code that should live here:

* Generalized database access functions
* Basic plots that are useful for a wide variety of experiments
* Calibration routines
* Analysis functions

Examples of code that should probably *not* live here:

* "get the standard deviation of a set of node data". Use `my_dataframe['my_column'].std()` as [implemented in pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.std.html) instead. Anything that is not Osmo-specific is probably already implemented in an existing library that we should use instead.
* "check temperature and time correlation of each color count for each node during an experiment". This is probably too use-case specific and will end up as unmaintained, "dead code".

## Using this library

1. Before you can consume the library, you'll need to [set up an SSH key with GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/) and with your computer's SSH manager. When setting up your key, leave the passphrase blank. This lets your computer access the private Git repository via SSH and you may have already done this.

2. Add these lines near the top of your notebook:

`!pip install --quiet git+ssh://git@github.com/osmosystems/osmo-jupyter.git@[CHANGESET]`

`import osmo_jupyter`

Replace [CHANGESET] with a changeset ID. Grab the latest changeset ID by [visiting GitHub](https://github.com/OsmoSystems/osmo-jupyter/commits/master). Once there, click the uppermost clipboard icon (ðŸ“‹) button to copy the ID of the latest commit.

**note:** This will be the exact library version that your notebook depends on.


3. Once you run the cell you created above, Jupyter will be able to tab-complete all of our public functions: type `osmo_jupyter.` and `<tab>`.

4. Some usage examples are in the Google Drive at [Technical_Osmosystems/Tools/Jupyter Snippets](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1A-Rlb-VYTwQ6Tl3sm12eR-cnmCHbj6UP)

## Contributing

### Feature requests

The software team takes feature requests and pull requests! Just talk to one of us and/or file a JIRA ticket in the [Feature Requests epic](https://osmobot.atlassian.net/browse/SOFT-306). Extra points for example code and clear explanations of what you're trying to accomplish.

### High Bar

The "bar" for including code in this library is higher than that seen in our jupyter notebooks. This is because:
* Code in a library is more trusted, less transparent
* Code in this library will be reused more, and thus it is more important for it to be correct and even more important for it to be maintainable

### Code Style

This repo follows the Osmo [Code Style Manifesto](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W1Ipug8IACL4PfZAq5bQKlmfcJGmHGKNH95_FwJcjaI) as applies to Python code.


### Installing for development

1. Check out the repository and switch to its directory
2. Install the package "editable" so that you can edit it and consume the edited version: `pip install --editable .`


### Running tests

#### Using tox
0. `pip3 install tox`  # Only have to do this once
1. to run tests and linter: `tox`
    - if you have installed new dependencies: `tox -r`
1. to continuously re-run tests:
    1. `source .tox/py26/bin/activate` - activates the tox environment that has everything installed
    1. `ptw --ignore .tox .` - use pytest-watch (ptw) to re-run tests if anything changes in the source code


### Generating documentation

1. Install sphinx and the sphinx_rtd_theme

    ```bash
    ~/osmo/osmo-jupyter$ pip3 install -r docs_requirements.txt
    ```

1. Navigate to docs/ directory:

    ```bash
    ~/osmo/osmo-jupyter$ cd docs/
    ```

1. Re-auto-generate docs from docstrings, excluding test files. (See [sphinx-apidoc](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/1.4/man/sphinx-apidoc.html) for details about parameters)

    ```bash
    ~/osmo/osmo-jupyter/docs$ sphinx-apidoc -f -o source/ ../osmo_jupyter/ ../osmo_jupyter/*test.py ../osmo_jupyter/*/*test.py
    ```

1. Re-build html docs:

    ```bash
    ~/osmo/osmo-jupyter/docs$ make html
    ```
